## About

Yet Another Diary App created for travelers who want to write about their experiences. Customizable themes with the fusion of maps and path tracking make it all the more interesting! 

## Contributing

The app is open for contribution during [PWOC](https://pwoc.vercel.app/). Start discussion in the PWOC Discord Server. 

To be able to use firebase services, like authentication, you will need to register your SHA-1 keys.
For that, make sure your Java's bin directory is stored in environmental variables of your PC. 
After that, enter this in your terminal:
```
keytool -list -v -keystore "c:\users\your_user_name\.android\debug.keystore" -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android 
```
 and replace  your_user_name accordingly.
You can share the SHA-1 Key with your mentor, and they will add it in Firebase console.
If you face any problem in this step, make sure to contact the mentor.
