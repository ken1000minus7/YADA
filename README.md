## Contributing

The app is open for contribution during [PWOC](https://pwoc.vercel.app/). Start discussion in the PWOC Discord Server. 

To be able to use firebase services, like authentication, you will need to register your SHA-1 keys.
For that, make sure your Java's bin directory is stored in environmental variables of your PC. 
After that, enter this in your terminal:
```
keytool -list -v -keystore "c:\users\your_user_name\.android\debug.keystore" -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android 
```
 and replace  your_user_name accordingly.
You can share the SHA-1 Key with your mentor, and they will add it in Firebase console.
If you face any problem in this step, make sure to contact the mentor.
